This is a end to end car sale application project. The trained model is used to predict sentiment of user based on review given to movie

## Motivation
One of my cousin looking to sell his car, then I saw it as great business problem. Like someone seeling his car and some third party buy it. So thought to first build a application which will suggest car selling price.
Another reason, I start thinking of become Data Science as I notice my interest in it. It sound so amazing that on basis of given data, we are predicting some day - today activities.

There are two technical aspect
First, after getting data I have prepare the model using RandomForestRegressor algorithm.
Second, after developing model. I have deployed my application on Heroku app <https://car-selling-trust-us.herokuapp.com/>

To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:
